	This is a tutorial challenge.
	
	- In this challenge, you are being instructed to multiply the two numbers
	together.
	- These numbers are passed as arguments when you test your solution.
	- In this case, those numbers are being represented by the variables "x" and "y".
	- It is your job to write a script that can calculate the solution based on
	the input given.
	- In the example below that has been written for you, the result is calculated
	by adding the two values together rather than multiplying them.
	- You need to edit the example so that it multiplies the values instead.
	- Once you have finished, hit "Test" above the test cases to check your answer!

return function(x, y)
	local Result = x + y
